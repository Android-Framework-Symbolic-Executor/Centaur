the first parameter is the output file from Eclipse
the second parameter is the folder where the analysis results should be put in
the third parameter is the path of mathsat (mathsat-5.3.10 http://mathsat.fbk.eu/download.html)



//to extract the path conditions that the corresponding paths really execute the targeted line of code
./analysis.sh '/home/lanlan/program/for-seperate/eclipse/output' '/home/lanlan/program/for-seperate/' '/home/lanlan/program/android_tool/mathsat-5.3.10-linux-x86_64/bin/mathsat'




//to extract the (partial) path conditions. All of the explored paths cannot reach the targeted line of code
//only when there is no result returned by the command above, we execute this command 
./analysis-partial.sh '/home/lanlan/program/for-seperate/eclipse/output' '/home/lanlan/program/for-seperate/' '/home/lanlan/program/android_tool/mathsat-5.3.10-linux-x86_64/bin/mathsat'
